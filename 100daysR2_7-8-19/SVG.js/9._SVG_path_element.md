# Path

It is used to create lines, curves, arcs and more. Path SVG can be executed by using the path tag.The `<path>`element in SVG is the ultimate drawing element. It can draw anything! The path element takes a single attribute to describe what it draws: the `` attribute.
M x,y | Move to the absolute coordinates x,y

> **Uppercase letters mean the position will absolutely positioned while lowercase letters mean relative positioning.**

For instance

    M 100,100 means "Pick up the pen and move it to the exact coordinates 100,100" ( this is absolute positioning)

    m 100,100 means "Move the Pen 100 down and 100 right from wherever you currently are." (this is relative positioning)
