# **Coordinate System**

This is a bit different from the normal mathematical cordinates. By cordinate system, I mean the method of representing points in a space of given dimensions. For

## Mathematical cordinate system
Along the horizontal axis, `x` increases while moving towards the right, and decreases whike moving towards the left. Then along the `vertical axis`, `y` increases while moving towards the top and decreases while moving downwards. 

## SVG cordinate system
Along the `horizontal axis`, `x` increases while moving towards the right, and decreases whike moving towards the left. Then along the `vertical axis`, `y` decreases while moving towards the top and increases while moving downwards. 


## Coordinate System Units
If you do not specify any units inside the width and height attributes, the units are assumed to be pixels. That is, a width 500 means 500 pixels.

If you prefer to use different units than pixels, you can. Here is a list of the units you can use with the `<svg>` element: 

Unit| Description
---- | -------
em |	The default font size - usually the height of a character.
ex |	The height of the character x
px |	Pixels
pt |	Points (1 / 72 of an inch)
pc |	Picas (1 / 6 of an inch)
cm |	Centimeters
mm |	Millimeters
in |	Inches
