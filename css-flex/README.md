## Display: flex
This makes the content of your page stack close to ano another ia a horizontal format. 
*the container covers the whole horizontal area of page*

## Display: inline-flex
This equally displays the elements stack horizontally,but its difference fron display: flex, is that
*it doest not take over the entire row, it takes the exact wdth, whethear, small or big*

#Display: inline
Y=This display the element as an inline element just like  span tag.
*Any height and width will be ignored*

# Display: block
This display the element as a block element like the p tag.
*Each element takes up the whole width on a seperate line*

# Display: contents
It makes the containing container disappear
1. *Every property that has to do with the container disappears. Only the children stays*
2. *The color, border, margin, padding of the containing element disappears*
3. *But the color and font does show up*
